# Multi-Class-Classification-Of-Vehicles
This is a Multi-Class Classification Of Vehicles using Machine Learning techniques and used different models for best accuracy.The 2-layer neural network works best, followed by logistic regression and SVM with a linear kernel. Random forest and K-NN comes next followed by 1-layer neural network and SVM with the rbf kernel.
